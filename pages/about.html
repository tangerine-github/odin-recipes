    <p>Well, how do I know what I want? To help answer that question, here is some basic info about cases, pcbs, switches, and keycaps.</p>
    <h3>Cases</h3>
    <p>Theres a lot of layouts to choose from. Refer to the image below to figure out what you want. There are also different case materials, but its usually ABS plastic or aluminum.</p>

    <h3>PCBS</h3>
    <p>There isn't much to discuss. If it didn't come with the kit, just pick one that is compatible with your case, and choose between soldered or hotswap.</p>
    <h3>Switches</h3>
    <p>Too much to talk about lol. There is linear, tactile, and clicky. Just get linears.</p>
    <h3>Keycaps</h3>
    <p>There are ABS and PBT keycaps. There are also different profiles, but just get ABS Cherry lol.</p>
